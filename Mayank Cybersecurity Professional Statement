I am highly motivated and enthusiastic about information technology and enjoy finding solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. I am skilled in programming languages such as C++ and Python and have a great niche in data structures and algorithms. I love to be logical and updated with new technologies. I respect privacy and will help to protect sensitive information and mitigate risk.
